# Lucaso.dev
:wave: my personal website, for tech blogs and other cool stuff I am currently doing.

## Why the overkill?
I think it's fun to explore new technologies, and what's a better moment to do so than when building your own website?

### ...so what're you using?
I'm partaking in a bit of React, making use of Million.js for performance, and Biome.js for linting, prettier, and a lot of other stuff. 

Did you hear that... yes? I am also using inline-css (Tailwind) since it sounds like fun to do so.  Of course, we're playing around with TanStack stuff as well (specifically Query and Router).

Finally, we're using Vite + SWC for sped-up build-time (I don't want to wait).

### So... what back-end are you using?
I'm using Rustlang (btw), specifically using Axum :)
